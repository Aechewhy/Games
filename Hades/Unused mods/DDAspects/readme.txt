List of aspects
---------------------------------------

Sword - Aspect of Athena

You can use sword and shield at the same time (kinda surprised anyone did this already). Attack with your sword, then block and bull rush. You can also bull rush into the middle of enemies and charge your sword special before arriving, but you lose your iframes doing so.

Spear - Aspect of Hermes

This is a simple one, yet my favorite. If you play with Aspect of Guan Yu, you might have noticed you can keep walking between attacks. This aspect adds a little knockback to each stab so you are constantly chasing enemies. That and you're not cursed with -50% HP, which is good too.

Shield - Aspect of Cerberus

Your shield throw is stronger, but only hits a single target. If you attack exactly when your shield comes back it'll deal more damage, similar to power shot. Here's a tip: hold down the attack button before your shield returns to make sure you always attack at the right time. This may sound too easy, but Aspect of Cerberus is not about timing, it's about positioning yourself correctly.

Bow - Aspect of Apollo

The attack takes longer to charge than Aspect of Zagreus, but not nearly as much as Rama. If enemies get too close you can give a kick in their face, or even try a backflip (kick while walking backwards, then fire your bow from a safe distance).

Fists - Aspect of Chronos

Whenever you attack, you start building up speed (Zagreus, enemies, projectiles... everything moves faster). Of course it gets harder to dodge attacks, but you also get a lot of extra defense to compensate. Your special does the opposite: it stops the time while you aim a long-ranged rush kick. Tip: if you don't want to build up speed, use special shortly between attack combos.

Gun - Aspect of Helios

This aspect is a combination of Rama and Lucifer. Your special fires 3 slightly homing projectiles that inflict shared suffering. Your attack escalates in damage and can melt big targets, and whoever was marked by the special.
